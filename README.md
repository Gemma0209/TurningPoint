# TurningPoint

VEX Team 4610Z Repository for the 2018-2019 game Turning Point: <br />
Based out of Summit, NJ <br />
3 x World Qualifiers <br />
2 x State Champion <br />
1 x State Finalist <br />

    What you should find in this repository:
    1) Source Folder for code during the season
    2) Archive Folder for code that has been deprecated in the event of a code clean-up (So it may still be easilt accesible in case of clean-up issues)
    
    Contact us on Discord or email if you are trying to implement code and would like our help:
